# MCQ-System-Java-Application-
the Multiple-Choice Questions System is built using the IDE to implement the algorithm process. There are three question sets in this system such as HTML, Java Basics and Python. Each question set includes the 10 questions and the user can chose to answer each question. The user will see his/her name and score after answering all question sets. And the user can exit after answering an entire question set or choose to continue answering.

In order to answer the question set, the CSV file is input to IntelliJ. 
Firstly, the user can see the welcome message and then input the user name.
Secondly, the user can choose three questions set and answer the questions. After answering, the user must know if his/her answer is correct or not.
Thirdly, the user can see the score with percentage.
